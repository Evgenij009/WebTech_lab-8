TEXT = "Ingenuity is a small robotic helicopter located on Mars since February 18, 2021. It is the first aircraft on Mars. It successfully completed the first powered atmospheric flight, from vertical takeoff to landing, on any planet or celestial body beyond Earth, on April 19, 2021.[9] Part of NASA's Mars 2020 mission, the small coaxial, drone rotorcraft will serve as a technology demonstrator for the potential use of flying probes on other worlds, with the potential to scout locations of interest and support the future planning of driving routes for Mars rovers.[10][11][1]

Ingenuity, now on the Martian surface, was attached to the underside of the Perseverance rover. Its deployment was on April 3, 2021,[5][6][7] about 60 days after Perseverance's landing at the Octavia E. Butler Landing site in Jezero crater. First takeoff was attempted on 19 April 2021 at 07:15 UTC, with livestreaming 3 hours later at 10:15 UTC confirming the flight.[12][13][14][15][16][17]

The rover is expected to drive approximately 100 m (330 ft) away from the drone to allow it a safe "buffer zone" in which it will attempt to fly.[18][19] Ingenuity is expected to fly up to five times during its 30-day test campaign scheduled early in the rover's mission. Primarily technology demonstrations,[1][20] each flight is planned to fly at altitudes ranging from 3–5 m (10–16 ft) above the ground for up to 90 seconds each.[1] Ingenuity, which can travel up to 50 m (160 ft) downrange and then back to the starting area,[1] will use autonomous control during its short flights, which will be telerobotically planned and scripted by operators at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). It will communicate directly with the Perseverance rover after each landing. Its rotor blades were successfully unlocked on April 8, 2021, days after it detached from Perseverance.[21][22]

If Ingenuity works as expected, NASA may build on its design to extend the aerial component of future Mars missions.[23] The project is led by MiMi Aung at JPL.[24] Other contributors include AeroVironment, Inc., the NASA Ames Research Center, and the NASA Langley Research Center."
